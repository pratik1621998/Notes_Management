# Notes_management
In this project I have added CRUD based Functionalities such as,

GET,
POST,
PUT,
DELETE

I have used MongoDB for Storing a data.

Endpoints
The API has the following endpoints:

GET /notes/all-notes: Retrieve a list of all notes.
GET /notes/get-note: Retrieve a specific note by its ID in the body.
POST /notes/create-note: Create a new note.
PUT /notes/update-note: Update an existing note by its ID.
DELETE /notes/delete-note: Delete a note by its ID.

I have used JWT Authentication in this Project.
